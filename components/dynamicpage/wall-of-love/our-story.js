    <div className='our-story-content'>
    <p className='our-story-content-last-para'>This is a 5-year-old journey in the making.</p> 

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>Udit Goenka and Oscar Hernandez started an outreaching project roughly 5-years ago and invested all their prior earnings in the project ..aka $200,000+.</p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>Unfortunately, this was a disaster that neither of them could ever forget because what was supposed to be a dream became a shattered dream.</p> 

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>This loss and failure were hard to swallow for a small business owner. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>Udit went into a heavy depression, so was the case with Oscar, who went into survival mode. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>Why did it go wrong? Both of us screwed up without blaming anyone else. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>But the failure led them to build PitchGround.com alongside Lukas Liesis, our Co-Founder and CTO. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>The outreaching tool was an unfinished dream, a dream that became common for all the founders. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>After growing PitchGround into a multi-million company, Udit, Oscar, and Lukas decided to make this shattered dream a reality, which is how Firstsales.io was born. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>With modern tools, technology, and robust infrastructure, Firstsales was resurrected. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>First sales is built for modern SMBs & Enterprises who never want their pipeline to run dry. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>With the most robust A/B/C split testing solution on the internet, no other tool comes close to Firstsales.io; this solution is FirstSalesâ€™s core USP. If anyone has to copy this solution, they will have to rebuilt their entire architecture. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>Why granular level A/B/C split-testing? Because there is also scope for improvement, and for any marketer/salesperson, A/B split testing is a way of life to improve conversions. </p>

<p className='our-story-content-last-para'>Give Firstsales.io a spin; you will fall in love with it because it will help you generate more sales.</p>
