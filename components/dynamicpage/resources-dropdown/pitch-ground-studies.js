<h1 className='ground-first-heading'>How PitchGround used Firstsales.io to grow its Marketplace by 71%</h1>
 <a href="https://firstsales.io/author/oscarhernandez/">By Oscar Hernandez</a> July 14,2022</div>
 <div>
  <p className='ground-text-section-para'><strong>Disclaimer: PitchGround is a brand owned by operated by Little SaaS, Inc. and this case study is about how we used our own software to grow. </strong></p>
 
 <p className='ground-text-section-para'> PitchGround was founded in 2018 by the Little SaaS team.</p>
 <p className='ground-text-section-para'>Its sole focus was to help online businesses grow with the help of software and education first approach.</p>
 <p className='ground-text-section-para'>We believe that education and software should be affordable, and easily accessible. When you combine them both, it creates a wealth of opportunities for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p className='ground-text-section-para'>To truly make an impact, the team behind PitchGround has assembled together what we call an Education-First approach to educate online businesses and help them with affordable software solutions, which earlier have been very expensive otherwise.</p>
  <p className='ground-text-section-para'>And like any business or marketplace, we have our own <strong>competitors that we must stay ahead of.</strong></p>
  <p className='ground-text-section-para'>The way we differentiate ourselves from other marketplaces is by bringing in high-quality SaaS, rather than focusing on quantity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p className='ground-text-section-para'>Unlike other platforms, we launch only 5-10 SaaS per month. </p>
  <p className='ground-text-section-para'>They go through a thorough evaluation to filter and maintain the quality standards of SaaS that are being listed. Thatâ€™s the reason why not every SaaS that applies to PitchGroud gets selected as a Featured Deal.</p>
  <p className='ground-text-section-para'>Most of the SaaS intake happens because of <strong>cold email outreach ( almost 90% )</strong>. </p>
 <p className='ground-text-section-para'>PitchGround has used SaaS like Mailshake, Instantly, Lemlistâ€¦all of â€˜em are good software within their own right, but according to our outreach scaling strategies, these SaaS werenâ€™t capable enough to handle what we wanted to achieve. </p>
 <p className='ground-text-section-para'>Even with<p>Plus, managing 200 accounts across 5-7 platforms is a <strong>managerial nightmare</strong> of its own.</p> multiple accounts on multiple platforms, we were not able to achieve the scale and results we were looking for.&nbsp;</p>
 <p className='ground-text-section-para'>Plus, managing 200 accounts across 5-7 platforms is a <strong>managerial nightmare</strong> of its own.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Thatâ€™s why we built FirstSales.io and started using our software to focus on scalability and granular-level split-testing.</p> 
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Firstsales.io helped PitchGroundâ€™s team to scale on their outreach efforts efficientlyâ€¦ and, more importantly, safely.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Before FirstSales we launched 100 SaaS on the marketplace in 5.5 months, averaging 18.1 SaaS a month. </p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>But after using the features that we have on FirstSales, now in a month, we have launched 31 SaaS. That is an<strong> increase in SaaS intake of 71%</strong> ðŸ™‚</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'><strong>How did we do it?</strong></p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>We combined Outreaching, A/B Split Testing, and Email Warm up in one place.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>In order to know what works, and what doesnâ€™t, we needed <strong>A/B Testing at granular levels.</strong></p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Now you might be thinking, <em>WHATâ€™S THAT?</em></p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>In other software, letâ€™s say if you want to A/B test between 2 subject lines:</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>For that, you just need to create 2 different templates with subject 1 and subject 2 with the body and signature remaining the same.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Andâ€¦creating 1 template will take you max 1 minute, right?</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>OKAY!&nbsp;</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>What if I ask you to create a combination of 10 subject lines, 10 body blocks, and 10 signatures.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Thatâ€™s 1000 templates ( 10X10X10 ), and<strong> it would take you 1000 minutes to complete that.</strong></p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>But <strong><em>with FirstSales it took only 2 minutes to create this kind of combination</em></strong>, and we saved 998 minutes ðŸ™‚</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>This helped us focus those<strong> 998 minutes ( 16 Hours, 37 Minutes, and 59 Seconds )</strong> on prospecting for high-quality leads, rather than creating templates.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Btw, FirstSales is the only outreaching SaaS to have A/B Testing of signatures as of today.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>The reason we went with this level of A/B Testing is to find the best possible combination.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'><strong>Wanna see the results?</strong></p>

<p  className='ground-text-section-para'>We were benching <strong>90% OPENS for every new campaign ðŸ™‚</strong></p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Now, we are reaching out to more people but, in order to convert more, we needed to make the right pitch at the right time.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Creating a normal sequence to just initiate the conversation <strong>wonâ€™t do any good for scaling.</strong></p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>The problem that we noticed was, that people, can be plain lazy or just super busy.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>When they see our emails, they actually like the offer but they are so busy (or lazy) that they donâ€™t put the effort to write 4-5 lines for asking out more information.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>So, we fixed this with events.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Events help you to shoot an email to the recipient, just after they open/click the main email (we focused on open).</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Hereâ€™s what our flow looks like:</p>

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/K7CBC-Tuh18UNLxluQNvUse6LvB-KlgIluzjqN-lNfbnYuC0Y7qTkwic30NY0H6piKwgbII6bJwosbfa8BKuEkscmtH3XHZVEWfqPSiteQurtQs1h_0hoiEyP04hHqz61A76f-MLcO3NJp2L5SxXFQ" alt="" className='ground-second-image'></img>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>And this literally was <em>a game changer!</em></p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>For every single mail/follow-up they opened, we were directly sending them the signup instructions.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>For us, FirstSales has been an advantage when it comes to cold outreaching, and a secret weapon when it comes to closing. As you can see, by simply using the events function within FirstSales a little differently, weâ€™ve been able to increase engagements and add multiple partnerships that will bring in hundreds of thousands in revenue for PitchGround in only a few days.</p>
<p className='ground-text-section-para'>Needless to say, weâ€™re going to continue to experiment and optimize this process, but we are extremely happy about the results weâ€™ve been able to get using FirstSales.</p>
