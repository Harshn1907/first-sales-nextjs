<p>We are pleased to release this brand new feature known as "Human Touch"

This is one of the biggest feature releases and updates to date.</p>

<p>This is by far the most innovative feature that we have built that allows you to send emails as if a human is sending them. </p>

<p>It gives you complete control over how many emails will be sent out, with various internals, and days not just on the email level but also on the campaign level based on the timezone you want.</p>

<p>No other competitor has this feature and will scratch their head before they build it, and by the time they do, we will be far ahead with even more no-brainer solutions that we are building at the moment. This feature is an absolute game-changer to avoid spam traps, and increases your opens and possibly reply rate too.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce that we have now released one of the craziest solutions in the email outreach tool industry.</p>

<p>You can now add as many email accounts as you want to an existing campaign. Most traditional and existing email outreach tool only allows you to use one email per campaign.</p>

<p><b>Problem with that approach:</b> </p>
<li>Campaigns are not scale.</li>
<li>Multiple campaigns are needed for the sale campaign. </li>
<li>Slow lead flow.</li>
<li>Higher chances of risking your email getting flagged.</li>
<li>People keep too high of a frequency of sending multiple emails since the account gets banned.</li>

<p>We took it to a whole new level to build a modern and robust yet simple email outreach tool.</p>

<p><b>This is what will happen with this solution:</b></p>

<li>Emails will auto-rotate when sending out outreach campaigns.</li>
<li>You can now speed up your campaigns.</li>
<li>You will save many hours per month on manual labor work of creating 100s of replicating campaigns.</li>
<li>You will not face issue spam issues.</li>
<li>You will be able to scale up your sales efforts aggressively by upping your hot lead flow by up to 40-60%.</li>
<li>You will leave no outreaching footprint.</li>
<li>Many other benefits.</li>
<p>We are taking email outreach to a whole new level by building real solutions that will make an instant impact rather than working on "nice to have features".</p>
